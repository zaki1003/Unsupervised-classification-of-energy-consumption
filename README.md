# Unsupervised-classification-of-energy-consumption
The objective of this project is to use unsupervised classification to summarize variations in the energy consumption of 100 apartments, observed every 30 minutes for 91 days consecutive. More specifically, we seek here to obtain a classification of days, uniform for all the apartments. This project is used for monitoring an electricity network.
